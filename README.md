# GoWhere
Heroku link: (https://gowhere-wdi6.herokuapp.com/)

A MEAN Stack Web Application featuring events. Companies would create events for users to join.

Built while exploring Angular 2 and MEAN Stack.

## Example Pitch

Welcome to GoWhere. Having trouble deciding where to go? Can't make a decision? Not sure what exciting events are going on?
Let GoWhere help you to make that crucial decision.

We realise that most groups of friends/colleagues can't decide where to go or what to do. And there's always that guy who sits on the fence and just replies 'Anything'.

Now with GoWhere, people can view events happening in Singapore and join the event.

## How to deploy to heroku
1. git fork the repo into your own github
2. git clone it into your directory
3. git checkout heroku
4. heroku create [insert name of yr heroku app]
5. git push heroku heroku:master **
6. heroku run rake db:migrate
7. heroku run rake db:seed

At this point yr separate app should be good to go.

If you nd to reset the postgres db that heroku uses in production:
`heroku pg:reset DATABASE_URL --confirm [your app name]`

To see more info on the heroku postgres db of yr app:
`heroku pg:info`

**NOTE: this step is different from yr typical git push heroku master, because we are pushing yr local heroku branch to your herokuâ€™s host master branch
